### Hi there 👋

My name is Alex, and I'm a programmer. Sometimes those programs get finished, and sometimes they even work! ✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on VGM at [Motasoft](www.motasoft.co.uk) and not much else to try and keep burnout at bay.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, how to dockerize projects properly.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on, any video games that need a game dev n00b, open source projects that help any community.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with, any of the projects I'm working on - I'm always looking for motivation 😅.
- 💬 Ask me about, game design/dev (I may not know much but I love talking about it!), how the hell any of my projects work, why I haven't finished them!
