### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I'm a programmer. Sometimes those programs get finished, and sometimes they even work! âœ¨

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on VGM at [Motasoft](www.motasoft.co.uk) and not much else to try and keep burnout at bay.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, how to dockerize projects properly.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on, any video games that need a game dev n00b, open source projects that help any community.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with, any of the projects I'm working on - I'm always looking for motivation ğŸ˜….
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about, game design/dev (I may not know much but I love talking about it!), how the hell any of my projects work, why I haven't finished them!
